  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  address TEXT,
  billing_address TEXT,

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS job_roles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  required_skills JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  hourly_rate_min DECIMAL(10,2),
  hourly_rate_max DECIMAL(10,2),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Worker skills/certifications
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS worker_skills (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  worker_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  skill_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  proficiency_level INTEGER DEFAULT 1, -- 1-5 scale
  certified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  certification_date DATE,
  expiry_date DATE,

);
```

#### Features Needed:

- [ ] Skill requirements definition
- [ ] Worker skill assignment
- [ ] Skill-based worker filtering
- [ ] Certification tracking

### üìÖ Worker Availability System
**Priority: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Simplified approach implemented**

#### ‚úÖ Implementation Complete:
- [x] **SIMPLIFIED APPROACH**: Availability stored directly in workers table
- [x] **DEFAULT SCHEDULE**: JSON field with weekly schedule (Mon-Sun)
- [x] **EXCEPTIONS**: JSON array for date-specific schedule changes
- [x] **DATABASE FUNCTIONS**: 
  - `get_worker_availability(worker_id, date)` - Get availability for specific date
  - `update_worker_schedule(worker_id, schedule)` - Update weekly schedule
  - `add_schedule_exception(worker_id, exception)` - Add date exception
- [x] **SECURITY**: Role-based permissions (admin/sales can update all, workers can update own)
- [x] **UI STREAMLINED**: Removed "Set Availability" link, kept "Manage Schedule" and "Exceptions"

#### Database Structure (Implemented):
```sql
-- Added to workers table:
ALTER TABLE workers 
ADD COLUMN default_schedule JSONB DEFAULT '{
  "monday": {"start": "09:00", "end": "17:00", "available": true},
  ...
}',
ADD COLUMN schedule_exceptions JSONB DEFAULT '[]';
```
- [ ] Availability conflict detection
- [ ] Schedule optimization suggestions

ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS crew_id UUID REFERENCES crews(id);
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS job_role_id UUID REFERENCES job_roles(id);
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS priority TEXT DEFAULT 'medium';
